# DayCovidBot
DayCovid is a twitter bot I made in June of 2020. The goal of DayCovid was to provide a 
resource to individuals to use to gather information about Covid using Twitter as a 
means to do this. DayCovid will tweet the statistics of USA's Covid cases each day at 
12 AM EST. DayCovid will also tweet what day of quarantine it is. We consider quarantine 
starting when most schools shut down for 2 weeks, then never opened back up. From personal 
experience, this was March 12th 2020, so this is the date DayCovid goes off of counting. As 
of writing this, the current day is up to 111 days (written 07/01/20). 
That's a whole lot of days... If you tweet DayCovid with `DayCovid New York`, `@DayCovid New York`, 
`DayCovid NY`, or `@DayCovid New York` - DayCovid will favorite and retweet your tweet as 
well as respond to your tweet with that state's Covid statistics.
